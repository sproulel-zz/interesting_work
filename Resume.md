    Engineering. Certifications in Autocad inventor, AutoCAD, and NOCTI

2017-2018
:   Data Science; Galvanize
    New York
    
    Galvanize offers a lot of unique opportunities for students. A program I worked closely with gave me 
    the ability to study the most recent nueral networks. They gave me insights and understanding into
    how these new nueral nets will be used in the future. I have a few of them featured. I got to work 
    on Adversarial Networks which are on the cutting edge of research on nueral networks.
    Focus: Deep Learning

Experience
----------

AWS Solutions Architect, Northern College

I helped migrate Northern College's new website for e-students to AWS.
I helped maintain the ecosystem. I helped build databases, and I helped 
make future analytics easier.


Technical Experience
--------------------

Self Driving RC car
:   I wanted to be working with the newest and most cutting edge nueral networks, so I undertook this project.

    * It has several different kinds of projects involved, and I have gotten a lot of help from my support at Galvanize
    * I combined both Machine and deep learning in order to get it to work, but I hope to have it fully implemented in deep 
    * learning soon.

Open Source Projects I have worked on:

   Warehouse: It is Pypi's new warehouse for packages.
I was working with NYC python a python group that meets to work on different python projects together. It's for sharing ideas, and we worked on this project to contribute to the Warehouse project for the migration to warehouse. 

Programming Languages


   **PYTHON:** 
I have been using python for awhile, and all my major content has been in python. I am very confident in the langauge, and it comes naturally. I have done a couple interesting projects with Nueral Networks in python. My favorite was the first reinforcement learning project I did. It was a project that involved making a cart balance a pole based on 4 different measurements. 


   **Bash Scripting:**
A major part of what I like to do especially with some of the kinds of projects that I have been working on. I like to be able to automate my workflow, and since I use linux. I learned Bash Scipting. I use it a lot. I plan to attempt to get my 

   **C:**
I am a curious person, so I like to know how things work, so I am frequently at NYC python trying to mess around with the python internals. I would not say that I am proficient in C. I wouldn't say that I could develop in C. I would say I have a working Knowledge of C. That will turn into a Knowlegde of C. 
   Basic knowledge of **Rust**, **C#**, **Javascript**

Things Recruiters Don't really care about, but sorta do...
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.
     * Spanish (Fluent)

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing I did
* I was published in an article for Milton Hershey, for my internship with Penn State Hershey Medical Center. I ended up getting hired on full time.
